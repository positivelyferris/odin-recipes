# odin-recipes
This is my first standalone HTML and GitHub project following "The Odin Project" foundations course. I will be creating a Recipes website with relative links to additional pages for each additional recipe I create. The following will be used as I have learned so far:

1. Use of GitHub and a good commit cycle throughout the project, also using proper commit messages that are descriptive as to what changes I am making
2. Using basic HTML tags to create elements and utilize attributes, such as HTML boilerplate, unordered and ordered lists, paragraphs, headers, strong, em, absolute and relative links, and images.
